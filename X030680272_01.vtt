00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.980 align:middle line:84%
SPEAKER: I'd like to introduce
the student body to President

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.290 align:middle line:90%
of the university, Mr. Shannon.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.350 align:middle line:84%
MR. SHANNON: Members
of the university,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I apologize for the
delay in arriving,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.530 align:middle line:84%
but I did want to give time for
the switch from University Hall

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and also to complete some
aspects of my remarks.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate your waiting.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I come to you today to speak
calmly and dispassionately

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:84%
about the events
of the past 10 days

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.820 align:middle line:84%
nationally and at the
University of Virginia that have

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:90%
profoundly shocked all of us.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to you directly
about a number of the matters

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
which fill our mind and
personally share with you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:84%
the concern, the
responsibilities,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and the commitment that
I have to you as student

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and the faculty, as members
of the university and to you

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
personally and individually,
as a corporate body

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and as individuals,
in other words.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.034 align:middle line:84%
This is a time of the utmost
gravity in the university

00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and the country.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to tell you that.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:90%
We all know it.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And I hope we can find the
best in every one of us

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:90%
to meet this occasion.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I ask you to listen to me and to
continue to help me in the days

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.540 align:middle line:84%
ahead as you have helped
me during the past week

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to preserve the university
as a place of learning

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:90%
and a free expression of ideas.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I want you to help
me to preserve

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:84%
the bonds of human
trust so that we

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:84%
as people and as human beings
hoping to fulfill our highest

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
ideals and human capabilities
can work rationally together

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and constructively
together to attain

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
the goals of the university
and national goals.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I ask you to listen, and I've
been listening constantly

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:84%
From the very beginning of
the difficulties last Monday

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:84%
night, students have been in
free and almost continuous

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:90%
contact.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Your advice and your
counsel and my ability

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to work freely and
with absolute trust

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:84%
in you and in what you are
trying to communicate to me

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:84%
has kept us still intact
as a university this day.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Faculty have participated
in the same way.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And the complete desire from
a wide spectrum of opinion

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.050 align:middle line:84%
to assist me in upholding
the university, whatever

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
differences of view prevail,
to preserve within a university

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.860 align:middle line:84%
free expression and
responsible action

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:84%
has sustained me in a
week of sleeplessness

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and of hours of
decisions, each of which

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
could irrevocably affected
the careers, the plans,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
the livelihoods, and even the
life and limb of each one us.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Now the very process
of listening to you,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:84%
as I think you can
understand, means

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that I shall do my
best this afternoon

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
to cover the things that
are upper most for us.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But the time has
not made it possible

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:84%
for me to cover
fully in the past,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.329 align:middle line:84%
and it has made it difficult
and almost impossible

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:90%
for me to cover it today.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason
there certainly will

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:84%
be fragmentary
aspects of my remarks.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.426 align:middle line:84%
I hope also that you can
understand the responsibilities

00:04:38.426 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:90%
that I bear as president.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I am responsible to see
that the university is not

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
used by those who seek to--

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle line:84%
seek to warp it to an
instrument of their own ends.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.640 align:middle line:84%
I have a responsibility to
all faculty and students

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:84%
to see that even in the most
unusual circumstances a time

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:84%
of terrible national division
that the ability of everyone

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
is maintained to express
views, that those views can

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.640 align:middle line:84%
be protected to be heard, that
they will not be interfered

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
with or harassed, and at the
same time as a State University

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I have obligations
to the community

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and for order and
for personal safety.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:44.840 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I've asked you to meet
with me this afternoon

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:53.150 align:middle line:84%
at a moment of such
crisis for the country

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and for the university
that we love.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
It would be less
than honest if I

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.972 align:middle line:84%
didn't emphasis this, the
gravity of the position

00:06:06.972 --> 00:06:10.830 align:middle line:90%
that we face.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But if it is outraged
love and reverence that

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:84%
make us all so angry and
divided in many ways,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.926 align:middle line:84%
let us remember that love and
reverence can also be the bond

00:06:25.926 --> 00:06:30.240 align:middle line:84%
and must be the bond that
bring us together if we are

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:90%
determined to set things right.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I am confident that both the
country and the university

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:84%
can take a lot of punishment
and still survive.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Given the present
condition, this

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:84%
is a good thing and
a fortunate thing.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that the
future of our country

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and of our university
deserves the best

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:84%
thought and the hardest work,
which each of us is capable of.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And you may be sure that
I am determined to give

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:90%
every ounce of my energy.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:84%
As we meet this afternoon
so far as I'm aware,

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
the University of Virginia
is the only major university

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:27.306 align:middle line:84%
on the east coast that is
really open with classes and--

00:07:27.306 --> 00:07:30.264 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:30.264 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.520 align:middle line:84%
--with classes and
scholarly work in progress.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.552 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, there
is the free opportunity

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:55.688 align:middle line:84%
for those who feel that there
are other matters are more

00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:84%
important to which
by the assessment

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:84%
of their own responsibilities
and their own duties

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to refrain from
attending classes

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.782 align:middle line:90%
have been free to do so.

00:08:06.782 --> 00:08:09.674 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:09.674 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I believe it is the desire
of the overwhelming majority

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:25.140 align:middle line:84%
of the students and the faculty
that the university continues

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.916 align:middle line:90%
to proceed, that it remain open.

00:08:28.916 --> 00:08:31.868 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTS]

00:08:31.868 --> 00:08:49.580 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.585 align:middle line:90%
This is a tribute.

00:08:50.585 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:84%
This is a tribute just
as you've interpreted it

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that we
are still sitting here

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:84%
and that you can interpret
a boycott and a strike.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Again, your strike
has not been one

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:84%
to interfere or to
coerce other people.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.324 align:middle line:84%
I've been struck and
impressed with this.

00:09:23.324 --> 00:09:26.228 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:26.228 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And in another sense, the fact
that we still are operating

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:84%
is a tribute to the leadership
of many individual students

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and of the student
body as a whole--

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:90%
as a whole.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:84%
An intend that we
should proceed this way

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
that the open opportunity--
and I'll talk more about this

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:90%
later-- will continue to exist.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And I shall count upon
your help, as I say,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:90%
as we go forward.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Your spirit, the spirit of the
students over the last two days

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:90%
has been magnificent.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I really have been never
more proud of the students

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and the faculty of the
university than I am today.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
you have come to me,

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.920 align:middle line:84%
the way that you have made
known to me your views in a way

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
that I can have that feeling
that we are working and working

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:84%
together with
sometimes divided views

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.430 align:middle line:84%
but always trying to
communicate and that there

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
is no division in
that sense among us.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Now never-- also some
mistakes have been made.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I do not exempt
myself from them.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I share in these mistakes,
and I have no doubt

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:84%
that as we try to work our
way through that some more may

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:90%
be made.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
We are human, and the
university-- and I'm

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:90%
a human being.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And the university
is not organized

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.820 align:middle line:84%
as the kind of organization
or human society that

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:84%
can act in the most wise
way under the conditions

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and make the wisest decisions
under the conditions

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:84%
under which they have
constantly had to have been

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:90%
made in the last five days.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Despite all this, I hope
we can be of good cheer.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:90%
The times are grave.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
But I see no evil now existing
that cannot be corrected

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.400 align:middle line:84%
in this university or in the
country if we work on it,

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:84%
if we work on it with the best
energy and with the wisest

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.885 align:middle line:90%
means that we can devise.

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:84%
John P wrote in one of the
morning newspapers that

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
was brought
attention has defined

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:84%
a good university as one
that has at its objective

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:84%
the development of
the free mind in what

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:22.630 align:middle line:84%
might be called the atmosphere
of competing truths.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:84%
This is an atmosphere in which
a man can think otherwise,

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and there are many
instances in which

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.640 align:middle line:84%
men can think otherwise
and have shown it here

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.360 align:middle line:84%
without interference
or coercion.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.314 align:middle line:90%
Let us maintain it.

00:12:40.314 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Now Robert White is also
the despairing president

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:90%
of Kent State.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I want to pay tribute again
to them at that institution.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I hear lunacy.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.840 align:middle line:84%
He says on one side I see
frightening repression.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:84%
On the other side,
I don't hear anyone

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.010 align:middle line:84%
in the center saying let
us examine, let us discuss,

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:90%
let us rationally investigate.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't think
that's true here,

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and I think that is
why we're here today

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:90%
and we'll keep it that way.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.969 align:middle line:90%
Now my comments--

00:13:18.969 --> 00:13:22.462 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:22.462 --> 00:13:28.949 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to make
comments about the events

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:36.410 align:middle line:84%
of the university
during the past few days

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and where we go from here,
how we move to change

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.030 align:middle line:90%
things for the better.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:48.990 align:middle line:84%
After that, I want to make some
suggestions about two things

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
that I believe we can do
immediately in a practical way

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.820 align:middle line:84%
to advance the cause
of peace in Vietnam

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and to bring about a change
in the national scene

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:90%
beyond the university.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:10.392 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Now one word about the
work of the marshal.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:90%
It had come to--

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.300 align:middle line:84%
it had been absolutely
outstanding,

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and I was disappointed to
have called to my attention

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:84%
today in the Daily Progress
a reference to marshals

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:90%
being exempt from arrest.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm calling on all of you before
I proceed to other remarks

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:84%
so that we will not have
occasions where students will

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
be in danger of arrest,
and I will do everything

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.150 align:middle line:90%
in my power to prevent that.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:55.578 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.578 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I would remind you that the
marshals have volunteered

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and represent every shade of
opinion on all of the issues

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.360 align:middle line:90%
and thinking that is before us--

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:84%
many of them strong sympathizers
in the strike movement.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.726 align:middle line:90%
That's a perfect example.

00:15:16.726 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:84%
We have both
opportunities exemplified.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Now in the fast moving
events of the last six days,

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:40.440 align:middle line:84%
constant discussions,
constant meetings,

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
constant communication,
it's very difficult--

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:90%
constant rumors--

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
be sure and accurate

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.290 align:middle line:90%
of all that has gone on.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to
give in summary

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:01.010 align:middle line:90%
and capsule a precise account.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to try to do as much as
I can in that regard beginning

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
with Monday night where it
began with the first knowledge

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:90%
that I had--

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.840 align:middle line:84%
that a number of
students had met together

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
in a deep concern, a deep agony
over the news of the deaths

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:36.780 align:middle line:84%
of students at Kent State and
wished to come to my house

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and wished to
express that feeling

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and wish my assurance that
feelings and expression

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and the university
properly conducted

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:90%
would not be interfered with.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I gladly told them
that I would see them.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:90%
They came.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.522 align:middle line:90%
We had comments.

00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:84%
I know some of them
in which I tried

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:11.210 align:middle line:84%
to express my sympathy,
my concern, and certainly

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:16.292 align:middle line:84%
the fact that no
harassment is ever

00:17:16.292 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:84%
a part of the philosophy in the
background of this university.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:26.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Despite this, a building
was illegally broken into

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:90%
and occupied.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And as president--
and as president

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:84%
of the university charged
with the protection of people

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and his property, I sought
to relieve that situation

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:84%
by a court injunction as
the most non-violent means

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.400 align:middle line:90%
of assuring protection.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It has been-- it has been
my effort to act with the--

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:21.060 align:middle line:84%
in this way with the least
requirement of any outside help

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:84%
to have operate within
the university for us

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
to operate as a university
and to discipline ourselves

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and not to require
other authority.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Now no police
action or any other

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.180 align:middle line:84%
was requested or was sought
or was use that night.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.920 align:middle line:84%
The building was cleared
in a very rapid manner

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.980 align:middle line:84%
after the reading
of the injunction.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:55.070 align:middle line:84%
An attempted firebombing of a
neighboring building failed.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And as I say again,
this illegal action

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
did come from a spontaneous
demonstration of sympathy

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
for the violence and concern for
and the deaths at Kent State.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Now on Tuesday-- on Tuesday,
peaceful demonstrations

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.670 align:middle line:84%
against the war and in
sympathy with Kent State

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:84%
were held and continued
largely throughout the day.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:84%
The injunction
contrary to some rumors

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:84%
is not one that prohibits
peaceful assembly in any way.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Now on Wednesday, again, that
Tuesday morning immediately

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:84%
after before I left
the university at all

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:08.004 align:middle line:84%
to try to continue
with the normal day

00:20:08.004 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:84%
before I left on Monday night,
I proposed and discussed

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:84%
with Mr. [INAUDIBLE],, the
president of the student

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:90%
council.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And he agreed immediately
for a memorial service

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:84%
immediately to express our
common feeling over the events

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:84%
at Kent State, the reason
why they had arisen,

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and to be available to the
student body of the university.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Also on Wednesday
and also on Tuesday

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:84%
evening, I understood there
would be demand formulated

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:84%
affecting both the university
and the national scene

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.060 align:middle line:84%
that the student council
would wait to present to me

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:90%
and to do so publicly.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I made myself available
to do this in order again

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
not only to be in
constant communication

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:17.579 align:middle line:84%
with individual students,
many of those who simply were

00:21:17.579 --> 00:21:21.275 align:middle line:84%
individuals, many of those
who has other student

00:21:21.275 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
responsibility.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:84%
On Wednesday also we had
events during the day.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, I came to
the students, made

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:84%
myself available to express
positive action that I

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.304 align:middle line:84%
had undertaken to
do on our behalf

00:21:43.304 --> 00:21:45.740 align:middle line:90%
and on your behalf of students.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And on that evening
in accordance with

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:84%
the university's long tradition
of the protection of freedom

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:84%
of speech through-- and you
have no idea of the vilification

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and the abuse that I have been
subjected to because I have

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:90%
protected that right--

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.600 align:middle line:84%
two of the most controversial
speakers of the day

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:84%
addressed a large audience
in University Hall.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Following this late that evening
between 1,500 and 2,000 people

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.040 align:middle line:84%
assembled in the
dark outside my house

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.798 align:middle line:84%
where I had retired with
my wife and five daughters.

00:22:25.798 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The mob was addressed
by persons, including

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.050 align:middle line:90%
those visiting speakers.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:84%
They shouted and were
agitated in many ways.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:84%
This was an absolutely dangerous
and frightening situation.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I refrained from any request
with previous knowledge

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.330 align:middle line:84%
for any kind of
police protection

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.270 align:middle line:90%
or any protection of any kind.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I refrained after
this mob was assembled

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:07.120 align:middle line:84%
from requesting or communicating
with anyone outside of one

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.190 align:middle line:90%
or two student leaders.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I also as a result of this with
the assistance of the student

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:20.610 align:middle line:84%
marshals, the mob dispersed and
left the house and much of it

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:84%
proceeded to Maury Hall, the
university building previously

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:90%
occupied.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Where the building was
occupied again damage was done,

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:90%
fires were set in two buildings.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.224 align:middle line:84%
Awareness of the injunction and
the action of student marshals,

00:23:48.224 --> 00:23:50.580 align:middle line:84%
again, resulted in
non-violent departure

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:84%
of these persons who had
illegally entered it,

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and a number of those
who did so appear

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:84%
not to have been students but
persons from away and outside.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:84%
During the night, the danger
of violence at the University

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:90%
reached a near peak.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
As you know, a crowd
assembled at the intersections

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:18.957 align:middle line:84%
of 29 and 250, a mob of
several hundred people

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:21.940 align:middle line:84%
chanting and
apparently threatening

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
the safety of
motorist and people.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.010 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:38.425 align:middle line:84%
If violence had
occurred there, there

00:24:38.425 --> 00:24:41.900 align:middle line:84%
would have been
an absolute riot.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Now as the movement came
back farther up 29--

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:84%
now I want you to
listen to this.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to--

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to give
you some explanations

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.248 align:middle line:84%
that I think are useful
and necessary to all of us.

00:24:58.248 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:84%
By following the recommendations
again of the students,

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
we were in a
confrontation situation

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.510 align:middle line:84%
with a large number
of police drawn up

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and with many students
drawn up on the other side.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And following the
recommendations

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:84%
of the students
and their marshals

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.646 align:middle line:84%
and the president of
the student council

00:25:28.646 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and with my specific request,
Vice President Williams

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:84%
advised the students that
the police would withdraw.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:43.520 align:middle line:84%
The police withdrew on the
understanding and assumption

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.320 align:middle line:84%
that the spectators would
disperse and they did.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:55.980 align:middle line:84%
The police-- the police
marched away immediately,

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and the spectators
dispersed, as I say,

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.215 align:middle line:84%
and the violence was
here again averted.

00:26:01.215 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:90%


00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is what
we're working on.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Now the intensity of
that threat brought

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.320 align:middle line:84%
about the strong recommendation
of the police and the state

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.810 align:middle line:84%
police that if such
mobs again formed

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and the laws against impeding
traffic and disorderly conduct

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.440 align:middle line:84%
were again broken
that action would

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:84%
have to be taken, that the
arrest would have to be made,

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that there would
be no alternative.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Now Friday afternoon
city, county,

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and authorities
and representatives

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:44.700 align:middle line:84%
of the state police
requested meetings

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.450 align:middle line:84%
with the officials
of the university

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:54.286 align:middle line:84%
and required that control of all
police and maintenance of order

00:26:54.286 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:84%
be transferred to the police
authorities at 6 o'clock.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.449 align:middle line:90%
I refused.

00:27:00.449 --> 00:27:03.443 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:03.443 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But during the night,
Friday night crowds again

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:84%
formed at a major
city intersection

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of the
central grounds,

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:26.654 align:middle line:84%
again, harassed passing
motorists and pedestrians.

00:27:26.654 --> 00:27:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Again, I had assured the
state police and the city

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that I would be in contact,
that I would undertake

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to be in a position where
there would be representatives

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:52.200 align:middle line:84%
of the university available
so that we would have liaison

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and again that we would have
the possibility of averting

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:90%
direct conflict.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:05.820 align:middle line:84%
The crowd was
again moving, and I

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
won't to go into all
the details there.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:90%
But the matter came--

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:84%
the matter came to the point
where I was not at the scene,

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.240 align:middle line:90%
was not able to be at the scene.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Someone at the scene in order
to preserve authority and order

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:84%
had to have the authority to act
on the judgment of maintaining

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:36.860 align:middle line:84%
the law and in maintaining
the order as far as assembly

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.448 align:middle line:90%
was concerned.

00:28:40.448 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:90%
As long as I could--

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.290 align:middle line:84%
as long as I could,
we kept in touch,

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:90%
but I was not able to do so.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And my responsibility as far as
a public official is concerned,

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I had to transfer that
responsibility to the police

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:90%
captain on the scene.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:08.013 align:middle line:84%
Now the law violations were
not so extreme that night

00:29:08.013 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:84%
as had been, I understand,
the night before.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.938 align:middle line:84%
The police and university
officials on the scene,

00:29:14.938 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:84%
however, came to the point in
the light of a whole series

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:84%
of five days of disturbances
despite my abhorrence

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.680 align:middle line:84%
of the use of police in
academic institutions

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.240 align:middle line:84%
on a [INAUDIBLE] night
of the difficulties,

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I believe that action
had to be taken

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.580 align:middle line:84%
in the interest
of the university.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And I consequently transferred
that responsibility

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:55.175 align:middle line:84%
and gave that
responsibility to carry out

00:29:55.175 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:90%
whatever action was necessary.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:04.992 align:middle line:90%
