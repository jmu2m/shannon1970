00:00:06.532 --> 00:00:07.990 align:middle line:84%
EDGAR SHANNON JR.:
The state police

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.000 align:middle line:84%
in the area, because of the
disturbances, in their judgment

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.418 align:middle line:84%
said that arrests should be made
if we were to preserve order.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:21.350 align:middle line:90%
[BOOING]

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:84%
The crowd-- the
crowd was certainly,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
as I say, not so difficult
as in the previous night.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.812 align:middle line:84%
And the state police, I
want to emphasize again,

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
were in the area because
of the disturbances

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:90%
the previous night.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:84%
They had not been
called in in that sense.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:84%
They were here in conjunction
of being available to preserve

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:90%
life and limb.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:90%
I also--

[BOOING AND GROANING]

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
The university
officials gave warning.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.035 align:middle line:90%
The state police made arrests.

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:90%
[BOOING AND GROANING]

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.130 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:84%
The involved they
pursued onto the grounds,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:84%
undertook a degree
that I did not expect,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.323 align:middle line:84%
and that we shall seek
to avoid in the future.

00:01:21.323 --> 00:01:24.634 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:84%
It was my understanding
that spectators

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
would be warned that
they should disperse,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and this obviously
was not understood

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.270 align:middle line:84%
by many persons not otherwise
involved in the matter.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
They had to suffer arrests,
were later released.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:84%
One of failing
consequences of arrests

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:84%
in riot or a near-riot
situation is infringement

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:90%
on the rights of the entity.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, we must support
ourselves at this university

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.670 align:middle line:84%
so there never be
need for riot police.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.893 align:middle line:90%
I like to emphasize again--

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:06.134 align:middle line:90%
[BEMOANING]

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to emphasize again that
in the action of these days,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:84%
with a number of times
when mobs were assembled,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:84%
there had been-- there has
been not a-- there has not been

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:90%
a single injury--

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:84%
there has not been any damage
or injury to any person,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and that is the purpose
that I will seek to

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and will do everything
possible to maintain.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to make
it clear that--

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I want to make it clear
that martial law has not

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.797 align:middle line:90%
been declared.

00:02:46.797 --> 00:02:50.136 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I have no--

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.020 align:middle line:84%
I have no feeling that we
are in the kind of straits

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:84%
where there is an absolutely
situation of conflict

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and absolute physical
conflict that

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:84%
has required that kind of thing
at so many other universities.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Now immediately after this
dispersal on Friday night,

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:84%
in the circumstances it
was necessary in the view

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:84%
of the police to maintain
a constant position

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
around the inside
of the grounds.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.498 align:middle line:90%
Now, as soon as--

00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:84%
as soon as I had an opportunity
to hear with and hear

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:84%
from students, to
talk with faculty,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:84%
I was convinced that the
university was prepared

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:84%
to continue its
activities, to continue

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
to assemble as we
done today in a manner

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
as we had been comporting
ourselves normally

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.900 align:middle line:84%
in the daytime
throughout the day.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I immediately requested
the state police

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:84%
to withdraw from
the central grounds

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.718 align:middle line:84%
and from the residential
and academic areas.

00:04:17.718 --> 00:04:20.891 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.510 align:middle line:90%
And we proceeded with the--

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:84%
we proceeded with the long
meeting here yesterday.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
We proceeded with activities
of events, of sports,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.160 align:middle line:90%
and of the ball last night.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:90%
And I am grateful--

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.050 align:middle line:84%
I am grateful to
the kind of spirit

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of attitude
that made this kind of thing

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.850 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:84%
The problem I think clearly
demonstrates the limitations

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:84%
of the demand and
confrontation procedure

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that we have worked
into during this week.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:84%
It has brought us to
the brink of disaster.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Now as the nine demands
that were presented to me

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:84%
have been according to the
expressions of the-- according

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
to the procedures of
the new student council,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:84%
in the orderly and
proper way when

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:84%
presented earlier for a
reprimand referendum that

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:90%
will occur tomorrow.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
An expression of student
opinion is most important

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
on these issues
of the referendum,

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and I consider these are very
far-reaching, complex issues

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that I have already
been considering talking

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:90%
about to a number of students.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I want this opportunity
for an individual response

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:84%
of every student
in the university,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
to have his opportunity
to say what he thinks,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and to tell us all
what everyone thinks.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Now some of these
matters in the referendum

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.228 align:middle line:84%
and some of the matters in the
so-called demands or matters

00:06:19.228 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:84%
that are already under
discussion will continue to be.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are members
that are not in my hands.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are members--

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
or matters that I can deal
with, but all of them are

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:84%
matters that each one of us and
all of us will have to do so.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't want
to take action again

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:48.520 align:middle line:84%
as president that will prejudice
or speak to change color

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:84%
the opinions of each
individual in this university

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:84%
as he expresses himself
freely on that referendum.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to say, however,
unequivocally, absolutely

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
that there are
issues here that I do

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.420 align:middle line:84%
stand firmly for in the terms
of full access to the university

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and to its opportunity and to
full participation of women,

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:90%
black students, and to--

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I have throughout this year
given personal participation

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and actual time,
energy, and money

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.740 align:middle line:84%
to these activities,
the energies

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:90%
I can assure you of the--

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and the resources
of the university

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
will continue to be put
to this to bring it about.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Now there's no more issue that
has been more intellectually

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally
disabling or overpowering

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:84%
in its total effect on
the lives of our students,

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
no moral issues or
enterprise that has cruelly

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:84%
reduced our capacity as a nation
to improve the quality of life

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:90%
than this war.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Our involvement has
reached a new intensity

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and has widened shockingly
in the past two weeks.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:90%
All of our students--

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:84%
all of you are deeply
and agonizingly

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.630 align:middle line:84%
concerned with this war and I
know it and I understand it.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.690 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And in this immediate
period of national politics,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.370 align:middle line:84%
for that very reason,
I am recommending

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.070 align:middle line:84%
to the faculties
of the university

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that they act now to
accommodate students

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:84%
by not reducing the
requirement of their courses

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:90%
and their degrees.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:84%
We do not change the integrity
of those and the value

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
to you that you will
require, but to do so by--

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:84%
but to accommodate students
by permitting delays

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:84%
in the fulfillment
of such requirements

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
in order for those of you who
do so desire to concentrate

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%
on constructive action in the
redirection of the nation's war

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:90%
policy.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.175 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:09:43.175 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Second, we must remember
that there is a future.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
For those students who feel
that the actions they have taken

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:84%
in communicating their
views to the government

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.339 align:middle line:84%
have had the maximum effect
for which they have hope

00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:84%
or that there are other ways
in which they can continue

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:84%
to do so, the
university must continue

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to teach and to discover
and to remain open for those

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:90%
that take advantage of.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.584 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:48.584 --> 00:10:55.480 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
We must continue to educate
and train for the future

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
while we meet a
present emergency.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:84%
We must remain open
to do so, and to do

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:84%
so without the necessity
of outside protection

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:90%
by our own efforts.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Now I understand,
as I have said,

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:84%
you're anguished over
the military involvement

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:90%
in Southeast Asia.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.963 align:middle line:84%
I want prompt action
to the end of that war.

00:11:24.963 --> 00:11:28.344 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:11:28.344 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I feel further more
that it is urgent

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:84%
that the national administration
demonstrate renewed

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
determination to end the war
and the unprecedented alienation

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:84%
of American youth
caused by that conflict.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.316 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:11:55.316 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Now I have conveyed this
alienation in the letters

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote to the senators,
and I said last Wednesday--

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
as I said last Wednesday,
I feel strongly

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:84%
that students'
views must be heard

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.060 align:middle line:84%
by those who are in a position
to influence and shape

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:84%
national policy if we are
to change that policy.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.570 align:middle line:84%
To see that our students
could be heard, as you know,

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I arranged for the delegation
to go tomorrow to see--

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:84%
to Washington to see
Senators Byrd and Spong.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I shall-- I shall also
convey to the governor, who

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:84%
will be meeting with
the president tomorrow,

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:90%
my expressions of your views.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:84%
James Roebuck, president
of the student council

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.420 align:middle line:84%
of the university, will
lead the delegation

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to see Senators Spong
and Byrd tomorrow.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I have written a message I
would like for Mr. Roebuck

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.970 align:middle line:84%
to deliver to Senators
Byrd and Spong.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:90%
The message reads as follows.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.820 align:middle line:84%
We, the undersigned
students and faculty members

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:84%
of the University of
Virginia, are gravely

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:84%
concerned by many evidences
of anti-intellectualism

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and growing militarism in
the national government

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.414 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:13:36.414 --> 00:13:39.802 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:13:39.802 --> 00:13:49.490 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Education has been
increasingly neglected.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Verbal attacks upon
universities, students,

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and the free press by
persons in the highest

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.210 align:middle line:84%
levels of government
have become commonplace.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.549 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:13.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The unspeakable
tragedy of Kent State

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
was received in
terms that appeared

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:90%
challenging and callous.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:24.229 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:24.229 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.130 align:middle line:84%
The promised disengagement
in Southeast Asia

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:90%
has been agonizingly slow.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.584 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
The recent announcement of
the invasion of Cambodia,

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
a critical decision vitally
affecting the lives and futures

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:84%
of all young men, was used to
reflect personal and political

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:90%
credit upon the president.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.556 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:14:56.556 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:84%
It has now become clear that
the decision was reached

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
without the advice and consent
of either the Secretary

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:37.231 align:middle line:84%
of State or any committee of
the Senate of the United States.

00:15:37.231 --> 00:15:40.598 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:40.598 --> 00:15:42.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
We therefore urge you to join
with your fellow senators

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:84%
in reasserting the
authority of the Senate

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:84%
over the foreign policy
of the United States

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and the use of the armed
forces in its support.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I have already signed
a copy of this message.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.961 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:09.961 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that every concerned
University of Virginia

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
student will join with me
and sign this message for Mr.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Roebuck to deliver it to
our distinguished senators

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.625 align:middle line:90%
in Washington tomorrow.

00:16:26.625 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Copies of this petition are
available in Pavilion 8.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I hope you'll help me during
the next few hours and days.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's got to be
done before early tomorrow

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:84%
to get every possible
signature on that statement.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I also in conclusion
urge you to continue

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:84%
to help us all to work together
to maintain the university.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:90%
